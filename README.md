# Amazon-Product-EDA-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
This project extends the capabilities of the StreamlineSuggest-Real-Time-Product-Recommendation-System-Using-Apache-Spark-Kafka-MongoDB-and-Flask project. We dive deeper into product data analysis by performing three distinct explorations after data loading and a strategic sampling process. Refer to the [linked repository](https://github.com/hash2004/StreamlineSuggest-Real-Time-Product-Recommendation-System-Using-Apache-Spark-Kafka-MongoDB-and-Flask) for specifics on data sampling and loading procedures.
